**“Educational Attainment of the Indigenous and Non-Indigenous Population in Canada for 2018/2019” Dataset Visualization**  
  
**Course:** CPSC 583 - Data Visualization    
**Project Description:** A website that displays the statscan dataset “Educational Attainment of the Indigenous and Non-Indigenous Population in
Canada for 2018/2019” in multiple representations/views. The website has an interactive map which the user could click on a province/country and the information corresponding to that region would be displayed in a dialog box and graph section. The user also had the ability to control the dataset variables in the
graph section which allowed them to compare various scenarios. These variables include graph type, population type, region, and year. See (CompletedProjectImage.png) to view a image of the completed project.
